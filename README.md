# valkey-glide-mcp

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) knowledge server for Valkey GLIDE, providing code generation assistance and migration guidance for building applications with the high-performance GLIDE client.

## Overview

This MCP knowledge server helps AI assistants generate code and provide migration guidance for Valkey GLIDE applications. Whether you're migrating from other Redis/Valkey clients or building new applications from scratch, this server provides expert knowledge about GLIDE APIs, best practices, and code patterns through the MCP protocol.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Generate GLIDE client code for various use cases and patterns
- **Migration Assistance**: Help migrate from other Redis/Valkey clients (node-redis, ioredis, etc.)
- **Best Practices**: Provide guidance on optimal GLIDE usage and performance patterns
- **API Knowledge**: Complete knowledge of GLIDE APIs, methods, and configuration options
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with AI assistants via Model Context Protocol
